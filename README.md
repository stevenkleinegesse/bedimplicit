# Installation Instructions

The easiest way to install all the required packages is via Anaconda.

## Anaconda

Create an anaconda environment, called <env_name>, that uses Python 3.6 and **not 3.7**, as gpyopt currently fails to work with that version.

```
conda env create <env_name> python=3.6
conda activate <env_name>
```

Then install the relevant packages via the anaconda distribution and pip:

```
conda install numpy scipy matplotlib
conda install joblib==0.11
pip install glmnet
pip install gpyopt
```

All the critical required packages are:

- python v3.6
- numpy, scipy, matplotlib
- joblib v0.11
- glmnet
- gpyopt
- scikit-learn
